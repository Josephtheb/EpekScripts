# EpekScripts
A small sample of scripts I have developed to increase efficiency as a data specialist. Other longer, more involved scripts cannot be shared due to sensitivity regarding business operations.

The zip radius script will not work unless a database is downloaded - due to its size of 400 MB, I cannot upload it to Github.

The address standardizer uses the "usaddress" library in addition to a number of other steps to properly format and standardize the address in accordance with US Postal norms.

The script to create directories does not create the actual directories used at my current job - the names have been modified for privacy. It can be easily manipulated, as well as used for a base script to accomplish a similar task.
